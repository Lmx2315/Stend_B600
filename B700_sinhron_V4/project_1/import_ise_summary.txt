Section (1) - ISE PROJECT INFORMATION
-------------------------------------

The following items describes the information about the ISE project that was imported:-

Project Name    = B610_sinhron
Project File    = C:/Xilinx_project/B610_sinhron/B610_sinhron.xise
Project Version = 14.4
Device Family   = Spartan3E
Part Name       = xc3s500e-5-pq208*

*This part is not supported in Vivado and is replaced with the default part in the new project.
 Please see Section (3.1) - "Target Device" below for more details.


Section (2) - EXCEPTIONS
------------------------

The following sub-sections describes the list of items that were NOT mapped from the
XISE file contents into the current project:-

Section (2.1) - Missing Sources
-------------------------------
None


Section (2.2) - Unknown Sources
-------------------------------

The following ISE design sources referenced in the XISE file are not recognizable in the
current version of Vivado. Please read the recommendation on how to resolve this issue:-

<ISE Filename>              <File Type>  <Recommendation>
"MainPage1.sch"             'SCH'        Locate the associated top-level HDL file for this schematic source in the ISE project
                                         and import it into the current project as RTL source. In case this associated HDL
                                         functional model 'MainPage1.vf/vhf' is not present in the ISE Project, you may
                                         want to generate this model in ISE by running the "View HDL Functional Model" process
                                         under "Design Utilities" and add the generated file to the current project.
                                         
"ipcore_dir/dcm_main1.xaw"  'XAW'        Locate the associated top-level HDL file for this ArchWiz source in the ISE project
                                         and import it into the current project as RTL source. In case this associated HDL
                                         instantiation model 'dcm_main1.v/vhd' is not present in the ISE Project, you may
                                         want to generate this model in ISE by running the "View HDL Instantiation Template"
                                         process by first selecting the 'dcm_main1.xaw' source and add the generated
                                         file to the current project.
                                         
"clk_dcm_blok.sch"          'SCH'        Locate the associated top-level HDL file for this schematic source in the ISE project
                                         and import it into the current project as RTL source. In case this associated HDL
                                         functional model 'clk_dcm_blok.vf/vhf' is not present in the ISE Project, you may
                                         want to generate this model in ISE by running the "View HDL Functional Model" process
                                         under "Design Utilities" and add the generated file to the current project.
                                         
"ipcore_dir/dcm2.xaw"       'XAW'        Locate the associated top-level HDL file for this ArchWiz source in the ISE project
                                         and import it into the current project as RTL source. In case this associated HDL
                                         instantiation model 'dcm2.v/vhd' is not present in the ISE Project, you may
                                         want to generate this model in ISE by running the "View HDL Instantiation Template"
                                         process by first selecting the 'dcm2.xaw' source and add the generated
                                         file to the current project.
                                         


Section (2.3) - IP Import Issues
--------------------------------

The following ISE IP cores referenced in the XISE file were not imported into the current project.
Please read the fail reasons for more details:-

<IP Core Filename>          <File Type>  <Fail Reason(s)>
"ipcore_dir/pci_core1.xco"  'XCO'         1. Could not find IP definition in IP file 'C:/Xilinx_project/B610_sinhron/ipcore_dir/pci_core1.xco'. IP file may be corrupt, or IP not found in the IP catalog.
                                          2. Failed to add IP. Invalid IP file 'C:/Xilinx_project/B610_sinhron/ipcore_dir/pci_core1.xco'.
                                         
                                         


Section (2.4) - Unknown Properties
----------------------------------

The following ISE properties were not mapped into the current project:-

Note: The "Property Specification in Project File" property in the ISE project was set to "Store non-default values only".
      To make the ISE default properties available for import into Vivado, please set the value to "Store all values" in
      ISE Project Design Properties and create a new project.

<ISE Property Name>          <ISE Property Value>
"Overwrite Existing Symbol"  'true'
"Target UCF File Name"       'list1.ucf'


Section (3) - MAPPED DATA
