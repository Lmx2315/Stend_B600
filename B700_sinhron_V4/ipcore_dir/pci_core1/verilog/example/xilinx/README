This directory contains script files for the physical implementation of the
example design after it has been synthesized.  Please consult the Getting
Started Guide for more information about this step.

The script files demonstrate basic 'bitgen' usage.  Please be aware that the
bitstream generation step will vary based on the desired configuration method
and clock rate.  Consult the development system reference guide and the FPGA
device datasheet to understand the configuration options for the targeted
device.  Additional information is available in the Getting Started Guide.
